            <h1>Welcome to the world of <br> Charles Grealy! </h1>
            <p>In May
                2020 I graduated from the University of Houston with a bachelor’s in mathematics. All through primary
                school math was both my favorite and strongest subject so it felt fitting to study it in college.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before attending college, I decided my career plan would be to become a programmer. I came to this
                decision after discovering certain programming fields require a strong math background. I researched
                what math graduates were doing in their career and quite a lot had successful careers
                as a programmer. Including my dad, who was a programmer for 40 years and coincidentally a math major!
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                In order to gain programming experience, I chose to minor in computer science. Well, after the first
                introductory to programming course I quickly learned that computer science would be a subject that
                felt rather natural. The abundance of material (ex: books, articles, StackOverflow, and FreeCodeCamp)
                available absolutely
                enriched the education experience.
                Programming sure does inject serotinin into my veins.

                I’m now applying to various entry level positions and I am eager to start my career in programming. Once
                I obtain employment, my goal is to pursue a masters and a doctorate in computer science. If I could

                        A quarantine project of mine was to create my personal website from scratch. I'll say it's the
                        most fun I have had to date! The goal in the beginning was to only develop a blog, but that
                        later changed when I wanted to expand on the challenge. First I acclimated myself with django
                        (Python). I learned about url mapping, creating views, configuring a database powered by
                        PostgreSQL, and template tagging. Then I created a layout from HTML/CSS and implemented
                        JavaScript to create pleasant features such as smooth scrolling and a drop down menu in the blog
                        posts. Finally, I was able to learn how to push into production via Heroku and transfer to a
                        proper domain.

                        Another quarantine project based upon an interest of mine, the stock market. Yep, I am
                        completely invested in the stock market - pun intended. With Flask (Python) and the help of the
                        Twilio API arose a chat bot used in WhatsApp. Since I became familiar with django by now, Flask
                        felt more natural - in fact maybe quite easy to configure. The program searches for stock prices
                        using a stock market API and stores user data in a PostgreSQL database.

                        Python Interpreter in C++

                    <p class="project-description">
                        An interpreter reads and executes code. Therefore, a Python interpreter reads and executes
                        Python code.
                        The final project for a class during my undergrad was to build a basic Python interpreter in
                        C++. One of my
                        favorite projects! The objective was to take a Python (.py) file as input, parse each
                        statement, and produce
                        Python-like output. The statements included variables, lists, or a combination of both. Output
                        consisted
                        of the list contents. It's as if you typed 'python' in the terminal, but C++ would become the
                        interpreter.
